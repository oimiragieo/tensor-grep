# tensor-grep (tg)

## Current State

As of 2026-05-08, the current released version is `v1.8.26`. GitHub release asset publication is now part of main CI, and the active follow-up branch is hardening stable installers and `tg upgrade` against stale package metadata, missing post-upgrade imports, and failed in-place replacement.

Current release facts:

- Release commit: `ce2c1a5 chore(release): v1.8.26 [skip ci]`
- Latest merged fix commit: `6f82d14 fix: publish GitHub release native assets from main CI`
- PR #60 `fix: publish GitHub release native assets from main CI` merged and released
- Main CI run `25535886184` passed through semantic-release, PyPI artifact validation, `publish-github-release-assets`, `publish-pypi`, and `publish-success-gate`; CodeQL run `25535886001` passed
- PyPI latest and pinned public install both resolve `tensor-grep==1.8.26`
- GitHub release assets for `v1.8.26` verified with the `native-frontdoor` profile
- Active follow-up: stable installers and `tg upgrade` clear stale package metadata, request the exact current non-yanked PyPI version when known, verify the target Python can still import `tensor_grep`, check native installer exit codes, and stage the new managed environment plus front-door files before replacing `~/.tensor-grep`
- Expected patch release from the active installer/update branch: `v1.8.27`
- Repo-dev doctor/search dogfood confirms stale in-tree standalone binaries are skipped unless `TG_NATIVE_TG_BINARY` or `TG_MCP_TG_BINARY` explicitly pins one
- Latest handoff: `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`

Current product read:

- `rg` remains the benchmark for raw cold exact-text search.
- `ast-grep` remains the structural-search feature/performance baseline; `tg run` is a validated useful slice, not full ast-grep equivalence.
- `tg` is strongest as agent-native code intelligence: scoped search, JSON/NDJSON, repo maps, defs, source, refs, callers, context bundles, blast-radius, AST search, rewrite planning, GPU inventory, and MCP.
- Stable managed installs should prefer the matching release-native CPU front door when the GitHub release asset exists, while keeping the isolated Python environment as sidecar/fallback via `TG_SIDECAR_PYTHON` and `TG_NATIVE_TG_BINARY`. Installer changes should preserve the staged replacement contract so a failed install cannot break an existing public shim, including checking native installer command exit codes before the staged swap. `tg upgrade` must verify the sidecar import/version before claiming success, including the scheduled Windows self-upgrade path.
- `--format rg --sort path` is the deterministic rg-shaped stdout contract. Token-saving output work should be a separate opt-in agent profile, not a mutation of raw rg/json/ndjson contracts.
- `context-render` / MCP context output must keep `edit_plan_seed.primary_file`, `navigation_pack.primary_target.file`, selected files/sources, and follow-up reads consistent. Check `context_consistency` when debugging agent handoff quality.
- Default JSON/LLM context rendering must include executable body lines for selected functions. Compactness may strip comments, docstrings when optimized, blank lines, type-only imports, and boilerplate, but it is not a summary-only profile.
- `tg ast-info --json` exposes AST language identifiers for agents without help-text scraping.
- GPU support exists and local devices can be detected, but GPU routing is benchmark-governed. Do not claim GPU speedups without the matching benchmark artifact.
- Broad generated roots need bounds. Unbounded `tg search --files --hidden` scans and no-ignore/unrestricted fallback scans through generated/cache/dependency directories are refused unless bounded with `--glob`, `--type`, or `--max-depth`, or explicitly opted in with `--allow-broad-generated-scan`. Use scoped paths, globs, file types, and `--max-depth` for `tg search` before reaching for opt-in. `--max-repo-files`, `--max-callers`, and `--max-files` are code-intelligence command budgets, not `tg search` flags.

Known current weak spots:

- Broad `tg search --files ...` over generated artifact trees can still be expensive; the managed Windows launchers and Python path-list output should force UTF-8, but scope file-list commands to the smallest useful root.
- Windows command resolution must be checked across profiled PowerShell, `pwsh -NoProfile`, and `cmd`. Old tensor-grep-owned `Python*\Scripts\tg.exe` launchers should now be removed or uninstalled by the Windows installer; any recurrence is release-regression evidence.
- WSL and Git Bash no-extension shims are part of the Windows installer contract. Verify WSL with `wsl bash -lc 'tg --version'` after shim changes.
- In PowerShell, invoke `tg` or `tg.ps1` for regex metacharacters. Direct `tg.cmd` invocation with unescaped `|` is parsed by `cmd.exe` before the batch file receives argv.
- `tg --version` is one-line by default for scripts; use `tg --version --verbose` for feature/SIMD/Arrow details.
- Installed help should show `Usage: tg`, not `Usage: python -m tensor_grep`.
- `impact --symbol` can be noisier than `blast-radius`; use `blast-radius` for direct symbol impact.
- `validation_commands` can be heuristic and should be treated as hints.
- `validation_plan[]` rows should include `detection` (`detected`, `heuristic`, or `generic`). JavaScript package-manager commands require `package.json` evidence; Python commands require tests, project markers, or Python layout evidence; when no runner evidence exists, emit no command rather than a fake `npm test` or `uv run pytest`.
- Implicit native resolution should ignore stale in-tree standalone binaries. `uv run tg doctor --json` should report them under `skipped_native_tg_binaries`, set `rust_binary_version_status = stale-skipped`, and keep searches on the Rust extension or Python path unless `TG_NATIVE_TG_BINARY` explicitly pins a standalone binary.
- Raw unsorted output ordering is semantic parity. Use `--sort path` for deterministic path ordering and `--format rg` for exact ripgrep-style text formatting. Sorted files-with-matches, files-without-match, and replacement output are regression-covered rg parity edges.
- Stable managed install scripts and `tg upgrade` must not trust stale package metadata immediately after publish and must not delete a working managed install before the replacement environment and front-door files have installed successfully. PowerShell native installer steps must check `$LASTEXITCODE` before the staged swap. `tg upgrade` must skip yanked PyPI releases and must not report "latest PyPI version" from unchanged local metadata without post-upgrade import/version verification. A PyPI-only publish is not enough when installers point at GitHub assets; release assets must be uploaded and verified first.

## Release Completion Contract

A branch push or open PR starts PR CI only. It is not a release, not a released version, and not complete release state.

Release versioning starts only after a release-bearing PR is squash-merged to `main`, because semantic-release reads the final `main` commit subject.

A release-bearing PR is complete only after PR CI passes, the PR is squash-merged to `main`, main CI and semantic-release complete successfully, the release commit and tag exist on `origin/main`, `publish-success-gate` passes, `git fetch origin main --tags` is run, agents fast-forward local `main` to the release commit, and PyPI/public installer availability is verified.

Do not report final version state before the GitHub release, PyPI/package publish status, public install/update path, and local checkout have all been verified.

## Start Here

Confirm command resolution and version before trusting behavior:

```powershell
Get-Command tg -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Format-List Source,CommandType,Version
Get-Command tg -All -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Format-Table -AutoSize CommandType,Source,Version
Get-Alias tg -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Format-List Definition,ResolvedCommandName
tg --version
cmd /c tg --version
pwsh -NoProfile -Command "tg --version"
where.exe tg
uv run tg doctor --json
```

Use scoped `tg` discovery first:

```powershell
tg search --fixed-strings "<query>" src tests docs README.md
tg search --json "<query>" src tests docs
tg search --ndjson "<query>" src tests docs
```

Avoid broad generated-root file lists unless the task needs them:

```powershell
tg search --files "AGENTS.md" . --hidden
```

Use one of these instead for agent-safe file discovery:

```powershell
tg search --files src --hidden
tg search --files . --hidden --glob "*.py"
tg search --files . --hidden --max-depth 3
```

Only pass `--allow-broad-generated-scan` when the generated/cache/dependency tree walk is intentional.

## Core CLI Workflows

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Basic search | `tg "pattern" [path]` |
| Explicit search | `tg search "pattern" src tests docs` |
| Fixed string | `tg -F "literal.string" src` |
| Context lines | `tg -C 3 "pattern" src` |
| JSON aggregate | `tg search --json "pattern" src` |
| NDJSON stream | `tg search --ndjson "pattern" src tests docs` |
| Files with matches | `tg search "pattern" src --files-with-matches` |
| AST search | `tg run --lang python 'def $NAME($$$ARGS): $$$BODY' src --json` |
| AST language identifiers | `tg ast-info --json` |
| Source lookup | `tg source src --symbol someSymbol --json` |
| Refs lookup | `tg refs src --symbol someSymbol --json` |
| Blast radius | `tg blast-radius src --symbol someSymbol --json` |
| Context bundle | `tg context-render src --query "how routing works" --render-profile llm --json` |
| Device inventory | `tg devices --json` |
| MCP server | `tg mcp` |

PowerShell expands `$NAME` and `$$$ARGS` inside double quotes. Use single quotes for AST metavariable patterns.

## MCP Surface

Start the server with:

```powershell
tg mcp
```

Useful MCP tools include:

- `tg_mcp_capabilities`
- `tg_search`
- `tg_ast_search`
- `tg_classify_logs`
- `tg_devices`
- `tg_index_search`
- `tg_rewrite_plan`
- `tg_rewrite_apply`
- `tg_rewrite_diff`

Call `tg_mcp_capabilities` first in PyPI wheels, sandboxes, and agent hosts so the client knows whether a standalone native `tg` binary is available.

## Validation

For code changes, follow `AGENTS.md` and run:

```powershell
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check --preview .
uv run mypy src/tensor_grep
uv run pytest -q
```

For fast agent-readiness dogfood before push, run:

```powershell
python scripts/agent_readiness.py --output artifacts/agent_readiness.json
```

This gate checks public shell version resolution, repo doctor sanity, `context_consistency`, deterministic rg edge parity, broad generated-root scan guardrails, AST smoke, MCP context-render smoke, docs claim hygiene, and the current `v1.8.26` positioning. It does not replace the full validation gate.

For hot-path or benchmark-relevant changes, run the matching benchmark before updating claims:

```powershell
python benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py --output artifacts/bench_run_benchmarks.json
python benchmarks/check_regression.py --baseline auto --current artifacts/bench_run_benchmarks.json
python benchmarks/run_hot_query_benchmarks.py --output artifacts/bench_hot_query_benchmarks.json
python benchmarks/run_ast_benchmarks.py --output artifacts/bench_run_ast_benchmarks.json
python benchmarks/run_ast_workflow_benchmarks.py --output artifacts/bench_run_ast_workflow_benchmarks.json
python benchmarks/run_gpu_benchmarks.py --output artifacts/bench_run_gpu_benchmarks.json
```

GPU benchmark `SKIP` is valid infrastructure state when dependencies such as Torch, cuDF, CUDA, or Triton are unavailable. Do not convert a skip into a speed claim.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| Claiming `tg` is always faster than `rg` | Keep `rg` as the cold exact-text benchmark; position `tg` as agent-native code intelligence with a validated compatibility set. |
| Searching with `rg` by habit inside this repo | Use `tg search` first, then `rg` for parity or fallback. |
| Running broad generated-root scans | Scope the path, use `--glob` / `--type` / `--max-depth`, or opt in with `--allow-broad-generated-scan` only when the generated-tree walk is intentional. |
| Saving tokens by changing raw search contracts | Add an opt-in bounded agent formatter/profile; leave `--format rg`, `--json`, and `--ndjson` stable. |
| Trusting stale native diagnostics | Check `uv run tg doctor --json`; stale in-tree binaries should be `stale-skipped`, not selected implicitly. Rebuild or pin `TG_NATIVE_TG_BINARY` to opt in. |
| Trusting invented validation commands | Check `validation_plan[].detection`; package-manager commands require `package.json`, Python commands require Python/test/project evidence, and absent evidence should mean no command. |
| Claiming GPU wins from device detection | Run the GPU benchmark and record the accepted artifact. |
| Updating docs from memory | Update docs only from repo evidence, CI evidence, or benchmark artifacts. |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |

| 1 | No matches found |
| 2 | Error occurred |
